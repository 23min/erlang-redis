Listfever is a "clone" of Amazon's Listmania.

I initially tried to write Retwis as an example, but I'm not smart enough to
understand the Retwis PHP source.

Listfever lets you create lists. Big whoop! Or is it?

In any event, Listfever makes good use of Redis. It also illustrates an 'e2`
application, which is a full fledged OTP application, but much easier to read
and write.

* Dependencies

The Listfever application has a number of dependencies, but each plays an
important role:

 | Dependency | Role                                      |
 |------------+-------------------------------------------|
 | e2         | Simplifies the Listfever application code |
 | modlib     | Light weight web application framework    |
 | erlydtl    | Django template support                   |

For dependency details, refer to the 'deps' section in rebar.config.
