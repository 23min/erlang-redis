erlang-redis is an Erlang binding for Redis.

* Goals

- Bug free

- Complete API implementation

- Easy to maintain

- Performant

* Approach

- redis_client provides an Erlang interface to the Redis protocol spec

- redis provides a complete user facing Redis API

- redis_cmd responsible for sending outbound commands to Redis

- redis_reply responsible for handling replies from Redis

* Status

Very early stage - bindings are not useful at this time.

However, basic protocol support is in place.
